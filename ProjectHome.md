### What is this website and who is it for? ###
This website is an overview of the JISC projects that took place during 2011 in the "JISCGEO" programme of work.  "JISCGEO" represents two things: (1) the ["Joint Information Systems Committee"](http://www.jisc.ac.uk) ( **JISC** ) which is the funding organisation behind this set of projects, and (2) " **GEO** spatial" tools and skills.

_This wiki is the personal notebook of the #jiscGEO Programme Manager (David F. Flanders). As this is David's personal notebook it will only really make sense to the him; however, DFF is glad to share his notes with you in an effort to demonstrate transparency and openness. In short, feel free to read but please know these are just notes so please email David for further clarification before assuming anything_: d.flanders@jisc.ac.uk

# Aim of Projects in this Programme #
The overall aim of the #jiscGEO projects is to _make geospatial tools and data more ubiquitous in all University subject areas so that end users can directly benefit from their use and re-use_; please see the [FAQ](FAQ.md) for further context and the sidebar links on this page for the historical context on why these set of projects have been funded.

Please find below a search engine, map and list of Projects in the #jiscGEO Programme of work.

## Projects in the #jiscGEO Programme ##
The jiscGEO projects were funded in February of 2011 (they will run for up to 9 months, until November of 2011).  These projects represent the first organised cross-sector effort in UK Higher Education Universities to adapt geospatial technology to a range of subject disciplines and institutional capabilities.

## What will these projects produce? ##
The jiscGEO projects represent a balanced portfolio of work that covers various subject disciplines (i.e. sciences, social sciences and humanities), institutional users (i.e. researchers, lecturers/teachers/students and institutional administrators), and products specific to solving real world problems (i.e. tools, services, guidance, advice, etc).

Projects will produce one or more of the following outputs (please see each of the project blogs to see which specific product they will be producing for reuse by the sector):
  * Tools, prototypes or approaches that use existing tools for the integration and recombination of information, services and datasets to meet the end user requirements and the projectâ€™s research or learning scenario. These will act as exemplars for others to learn from.
  * Information and datasets made available or software developer reuse.
  * Enhancements to geospatial data, tools, infrastructure and services.
  * Data and resources that are geospatially enabled for reuse.
  * Evidence of the impact on the research, learning and organisation scenarios
  * Outlining successes and gaps with regards to how the HE/FE sector is progressing in their use of geospatial.

All projects MUST produce the following outputs:
  * A blog to support the project development and engagement with other projects and wider community.
  * Recommendations regarding take-up of geospatial to the wider community.
  * Recommendations to improve geospatial tools and to inform the academic [Data Infrastructure](Spatial.md).
  * Documentation on the project experience that will contribute to the community synthesis project and community project.  Such documentation must cover, where appropriate, the implementation of interoperability standards, and the use of and take-up of tools and services including issues of policy and skills.

Projects will do their uptmost to engage the wider UK higher education community so that the work will enable other institutions to take advantage of the outputs and experiences, aka please do not hesitate to contact project to ask them questions (projects are subject to FoI).

# So what is 'geospatial' and why does it matter to Universities? #
For a general guide on geospatial please watch the below video from Penn State University http://geospatialrevolution.psu.edu/ or for more specifics on why JISC groups projects together in Programmes to help affect change see the [FAQ](FAQ.md) (Frequently Asked Questions):
