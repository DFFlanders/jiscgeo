## Final Project Product ##


http://leicesterhalogen2.blogspot.com/2011/11/halogen-2-project-final-product-post.html

The final product produced by the project is a a geospatial web based visualisation tool called HALO-view that displays results via Google maps for the easy viewing of data held in the HALOGEN database.
  * The primary product is targeted at two specific groups of researchers at the University of Leicester. The cross-disciplinary ‘Roots of the British’ collaboration
(www2.le.ac.uk/projects/roots-of-the-british) between scholars in humanities and genetics who seek to interrogate evidence for the migration and/or continuity of human populations in the British Isles and the related ‘Impact of Diasporas’ Project headed by Dr Joanna Story. To support the Leverhulme Trust funded Diasporas Project five additional post docs have been recruited, two of which will have specific responsibility for analysing and modelling relevant data. This tool is seen as a key starting point for this data analyses work.


Additional soft products that the project produced include:
  * 1. Acquiring, cleaning, formatting and ingesting 2 new sources of data into the HALOGEN database. The first of these is data on surname distributions based on 1881 census, and the second was additional genetics data from Capelli. In addition, the existing Portable Antiquities Scheme data was extended to cover the whole of England.
  * 2. To develop and deliver better tools to researchers so that people with different levels of technical skill could access and get value from the HALOGEN datasets.
  * In addition to the geospatial visualisation tool (primary product) described above, a prototype data extraction tool was developed using Business Objects to allow researchers an easy way of accessing HALOGEN data and extracting subsets of data for statistical analyses with tools that they are familiar with (e.g. SPSS, SAS, Excel).
  * The project enabled staff in the central IT Services function to develop relevant technical skills and competencies to support researchers.	The success of projects like HALOGEN2 helps build the credibility of the central IT Services function with researchers and as a result more research groups are considering/opting to use central facilities as opposed to developing local/departmental systems. This helps reduce the University's cost base. An example of this is that as a direct result of this project the Institute for Name Studies at University of Nottingham are going to host their data on the Leicester infrastructure.
  * In addition, the Key to English Place Names enquiry facility has been adopted by the Institute of Name Studies at the University of Nottingham and will replace the existing enquiry facilities on their website. This will be used by researchers working with the Institute and by members of the general public who are interested in place name etymology and who access the website out of general interest.

The Project's developer was Olly Butters, ob30@leicester.ac.uk

Other team members include: Andrew Bradley, Mark Widdowson, Liam Gretton, Anthony Gibson and David Downton

Users of the final project product were: Prof Mark Jobling (Senior Research Fellow in Genetics); Dr Turi King (Genetics); Dr Phillip Shaw (Lecturer in English Language and Old English); Dr Jayne Carroll (Director of the Institute for Name Studies, University of Nottingham). Dr. Nick Tate (GIS Specialist, Department of Geography). In addition to these 'specilist users' the HALO-view product was tested by a group of staff (c.5 people) at the University who had no prior knowledge of the project.

#### Original Project Proposal ####
This project proposed that it will significantly enhance the 'HALOGEN cross disciplinary spatial research database' established in 2010 by extending exisiting and adding new sources of data, and delivering new tools to researchers to improve their access to data. 	The HALOGEN2 Database is avaialable at www.le.ac.uk/Halogen.  This database is used to support the multidisciplinary [‘Roots of the British’ and ‘Diasporas’ research collaborations](http://www2.le.ac.uk/projects/roots-of-the-british) that seeks to interrogate evidence for the migration and/or continuity of human populations in the British Isles in the distant past. HALOGEN is now a key research tool underpinning the work of these teams. It is intended to: extend the coverage of existing Portable Antiquities Scheme data in the database; add three new sources of spatial data relating to surname distributions and genetics; investigate and deploy an improved ‘data extract’ tool to enable researchers easier access to data; and to undertake a feasibility study into the provision of a simple web-based enquiry tool. These enhancements will add significant value to this research asset. The work will cover all phases of the project life cycle from requirements analyses through to the implementation of practical, cost-effective solutions which exploit the existing research assets within the organisation in terms of the IT infrastructure and technical expertise both within IT Services and Geography.

## Terms & Conditions ##
The project was funded as part of JISC's "INF11" Portfolio within the "JISCGEO" Programme.  Grant funding of £85,000GBP was awarded to the project for 10 months, starting on 1-Feb-2011 until 31-Oct-2011.
