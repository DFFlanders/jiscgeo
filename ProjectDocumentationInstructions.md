# Introduction to Project Documentation #
All JISC projects are _required_ to complete documentation as per their Grant obligations.

### What you'll need to publish your documentation ###
  1. **A Project Blog**: all documentation must go through a project blog, i.e. posts in feeds with tags.
  1. **An Analytics Engine**: all online resources produced by the project (blog, code repository, website, etc) must be monitored via analytics (e.g. Google Analytics or Piwik).
  1. **A Declaration** on which set of licenses you are going to use for anything you create during the course of the project (e.g. content, code, etc)

_See the DocumenationTools page for instructions on how to set up your project blog, analytics engine and how to select your license._

## Aim of documentation ##
Project Blog Aim, aka _'why am I using a blog'_:  To engage the community in an open conversation on how your project is changing geospatial for the sector.
