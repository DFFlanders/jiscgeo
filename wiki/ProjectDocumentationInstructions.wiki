= Introduction to Project Documentation =
All JISC projects are _required_ to complete documentation as per their Grant obligations.  

=== What you'll need to publish your documentation ===
  # *A Project Blog*: all documentation must go through a project blog, i.e. posts in feeds with tags. 
  # *An Analytics Engine*: all online resources produced by the project (blog, code repository, website, etc) must be monitored via analytics (e.g. Google Analytics or Piwik).  
  # *A Declaration* on which set of licenses you are going to use for your documenation.

_See the DocumenationTools page for instructions on how to set up your project blog, analytics engine and how to select your license._

== Aim of documentation == 
Project Blog Aim, aka _'why am I using a blog'_:  To engage the community in an open conversation on how your project is changing geospatial for the sector.
