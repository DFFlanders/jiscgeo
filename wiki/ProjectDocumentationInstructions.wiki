= Introduction to Project Documentation =
All JISC projects are *required* to complete documentation.  All documentation must go through a project blog.

*Aim of documentation, aka 'why am I using a blog'*:  To engage a group of likeminded peers in the 'wins' and 'fails' of your project as it progresses.

Below is a list of documentation you will need to complete so as to fulfil your remit as a JISC funded project.

= Overview of jiscGEO Project Documentation =
_*Below are the seven steps you must complete as part of your :*_
All projects must have a blog and communicate all project information through it (i.e. posts in feeds with tags).
  # Step 1: *Project Tag* - Creation of a _unique_ and _memorable_ project tag, please see: http://bit.ly/uniqueTag 
  # Step 2: *The Project Plan* - 7 posts copy/pasted (and shortened) from your project bid outlining your project plan.
  # Step 3: *Progress Posts* - A minimum of one post per month should be posted _with appropriate tags_
  # Step 4: *Final Product Post* - This post lists the final _reusable product_ delivered by the project.  
  # Step 5: *Final Project Spend Budget* - To end your Grant obligations the project must submit and have approved your final spend budget. 
  # Step 6: *Final Sign-off Survey Form* - You and your team must fill out this final survey that will list all the intangible products produced during your projects (i.e. lessons learned, skills gained, internal processes changed, contacts made, people influenced, etc).  
  # Step 7: *Project Completion and Archiving* - A completion certificate will be issues alongside a list of the all the resources you have produced which will be archived in the UK Web Archive.

*_Please remember all documents you create as part of your project are subject to FOI so best to maintain best practice with regards to transparency and openness throughout your project - and don't forget to display your Creative Commons License on EVERYTHING_*
