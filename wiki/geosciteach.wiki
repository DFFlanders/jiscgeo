== Final Project Product ==
[http://geosciteach.wordpress.com/2011/11/11/science-goes-geospatial-with-geosciteach-a-teacher-toolkit-for-integrating-geospatial-concepts-into-science-learning/ Product Advertisement and instructions for using]

Likely users of the product are: Lecturers/administrators involved in teacher training colleges/ courses; teacher trainers; teachers trainees; teachers; head teachers.

The final project product is an "An EPUB providing a ‘Teacher toolkit for integrating geospatial concepts into science learning’, this product consisting of: a.) An introduction to the GeoSciTeach app, a description of who it is designed for, and what it is designed to do; b.) An overview of what geospatial is and how it relates to science teaching and learning, c.) A pictorial description of how to use the app to design an exemplary science learning activity, illustrating how this fosters geospatial thinking, d.) A case study of its use in situ – at the Royal Botanical Gardens at Kew, UK, e.) Teachers’ own views and thoughts on the app, f.) Illustrations of alternative contexts/ domains of use, g.) A framework of the relationship between geospatial and science, and how GeoSciTeach supports this"	"A working prototype application on android smart phones that provides a customisable template for GIS supported science teaching and learning.

"GeoSciTeach: a teacher-based geo-spatial application for orchestrating scientific fieldwork activity"	

Keywords for this project: geospatial; staff development; learning and teaching practice; learner experience; trainee teachers; teacher trainers & lecturers; science fieldwork; science, science teaching, science learning, teacher trainees; teacher training; smart phone application;science teacher training; prototype application on smart phones; exemplary geo-spatial based science teaching activities.

The original aim of the GeoSciTeach project was to increase the use of geospatial tools in teacher training education by designing developing, and evaluating an innovative application, using the advanced sensing functionality of mobile smartphones. It aims to provide a customisable template for teachers to develop and orchestrate geo-spatial based science learning activities, that can be used within the teacher-training curriculum, and be made available as a teaching tool with associated educational resources.
