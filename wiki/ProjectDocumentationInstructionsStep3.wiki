=== Progress Posts ===

The following topics make up some of the suggested Progress Posts (you can do these posts in the order you see as most pragmatic to your project).  MAKE SURE TO USE REQUIRED TAGS where appropriate.

* We would like you to write a blog post on the following themes during the course of your project, though you are welcome to find variance in the theme as you see fit.  We are not prescriptive here and really want you to write something that people in the community will want to read, i.e. don't write them for JISC alone.
  * You must cover all the topic themes (and use all the tags) below: be that in ten separate posts or in three or four longer posts (though our preference is for early and often where possible).
  * Please do be imaginative and use these posts to broadcast the things you are achieving to the wider sector.

|| * Suggested Progress Post Topics* || *Description / Example* || *Required Tags* ||
|| "Project Evaluation" aka iterative reflection || Undertake a quick iterative evaluation process, aka something that can be done when you are board waiting for public transportation (e.g.[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SWOT_analysis SWOT analysis]) of your project.  The key is to truly knowing thyself or at least your project. || SWOT, projectEvaluation, jiscGEO, progressPost, inf11, JISC, <-- and don't forget your project tag! ||
|| "User participation" aka use cases || What is the core user case(s) you think of when developing the app; how has this story changed as you have engaged with the end user e.g. "we often talk about Sam the part time working student we met while at...".  Bonus points for actually talking about real end-users you are working with (note: you are not the end user!) || userCase, endUser, jiscGEO, progressPost, inf11, JISC, <-- and don't forget your project tag! ||
|| "Day-to-day work" aka tools, tips and trick that make you productive || What software tools or productivity methods do you use and how do you use them?  How do they make you more productive and why do you see value in using them?  Any and all tools, methodologies or diagrams showing off the way your project is run from an individual or team perspective are welcome. || methodology, implementation, productivity, progressPosts, jiscGEO, inf11, JISC, <-- and don't forget your project tag! ||
|| "Technical standards" aka stuff you reuse || What technologies, frameworks, standards or anything else that makes your life easier (or harder) in your work.  For example: what programming language (or framework, IDE, pattern, etc) do you use and why do you love it, e.g. "why I love Object Relational Mapping in Python and Django" or "why I think SWORD is great but could do this...", please remember to provide links for standards and acronyms, etc. || techStandards, technicalDevelopment, progressPosts, jiscGEO, inf11, JISC, <-- and don't forget your project tag! ||
|| "Value Add" aka what shifted your thinking in a new direction || What was the most important thing you discovered that brought value to your project, e.g. what was the deciding factor that made you make a specific decision on a what technology, process or human process you were going to use? ||  valueAdd, disruptiveInnovation, progressPosts, jiscGEO, inf11, JISC, <-- and don't forget your project tag! ||
|| "Small WIN(s") & "FAIL(s)"* aka advice others could benefit from ||  Announce small wins for the project, e.g. when you finish a coding sprint or when a user has a 'wow your software is cool' moment.  The more of these short "win" posts the better!  Also don't forget to post the FAIL(s) as well: telling people where things went wrong so they don't repeat mistakes is priceless for a thriving community. || WIN or FAIL, progressPosts, jiscGEO, inf11, JISC, <-- and don't forget your project tag!||
