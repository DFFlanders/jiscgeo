    * *Instructions for filling out the final budget spreadsheet:* We recommend cloning the following Google Spreadsheet so that it is easy to publish the final budget online once completed.  If you would like to use the Excel version of this template you will be responsible for publishing the budget as a CSV version of the budget on the open web so as to [http://inkdroid.org/journal/2010/06/04/the-5-stars-of-open-linked-data/ make the data open and easily reusable].

      * If you would like to request that the budget be redacted from being published online you will need to write out a project blog post outlining which parts of the budget will need to be redacted and why, this post must justify to the wider community and to JISC why your publiclly funded projects should not be openly reported along with what data about the budget you will be making available to the wider community for reuse.  This report does not guarantee that any parts of the budget will be redacted and is subject to JISC's decision.
