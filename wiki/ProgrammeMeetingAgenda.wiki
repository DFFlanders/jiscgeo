*Where*: Ravensborough College in London (next to the Millenium Dome). Tube Stop: North Greenwich (see below for picture).

*Who*: This is an open event that anyone is welcome to attend, however this event is specifically for the set of projects that make up the JISCgeo Programme of Work and so the emphasis will be on the products they have produced via their projects and how they are usable for students, researchers, lecturers and other University and College staff.  Participants should have an understanding of technical development (have you participated in creating an iPhone App or wanted to?) and also some understanding of geospatial technologies and how they work (i.e. do you know what a KML file is?).

*What*: The JISCgeo Projects are made up of a dozen projects who have worked for one year on demonstrating the value of geospatial technologies in the UK Higher and Further Education (University) sector.  This meeting is their opportunity to show off what they have created and demonstrate its value for students, researchers and lecturers.  Some of the events will use a organising strategy known as "open technology" or "unconference".
