*When*: Please note that there are several Geospatial related events happening the Week of November 28th - December 1st: so we would encourage you to pick and choose individual or groups of days you want to attend.  In summary, the following events are taking place:
  * Mon (Nov 28) 10am-5pm = JISCgeo Programme Meeting (Geospatial Product Show & Tell) - this is a free and open event that anyone can attend. 
    * Mon Night (Nov 29) 7pm - 11pm = JISC Geospatial Innovation Awards Party 
  * Tues (Nov 29) 10am - 5pm = JISCgeo Programme Meeting (Pathways to Sustainability) - this is a free and open event that anyone can attend.

*Where*: Ravensborough College in London (next to the Millenium Dome). Tube Stop: North Greenwich (see below for picture).

*Who*: This is an open event that anyone is welcome to attend, however this event is specifically for the set of projects that make up the JISCgeo Programme of work and so the emphasis will be on the products they have produced via their year long projects and how they will improve the use of geospatial technologies for students, researchers, and lecturers.  Participants should have an understanding of understanding of technology (e.g. do you own an iPhone and/or Android and know the difference?) and also some understanding of geospatial technologies and how they work (e.g. do you know the difference between Google Earth and Google Maps?).

*What*: The JISCgeo Projects are made up of a dozen projects who have worked for the past year on demonstrating the value of geospatial technologies in the UK Higher and Further Education (University) sector.  This meeting is their opportunity to show off what they have created and demonstrate its value for students, researchers and lecturers.  Some of the events will use a organising strategy known as "open technology" or "unconference" to encourage networking and showcase moments.
