#summary this page outlines a generic agenda for the Programme Manager's SiteVisit.
#labels PageType-ProgrammeDocumentation

= Why visit each project face-to-face? =

From the Programme Manager's point of view the site visit is the most significant time spent with projects as it gives a chance to find out what each individual project is excited and passionate about.  Why care about excitement and passion? - Because, these are the things that drive change and innovation (well that and a really good user-centric idea). 

* _In short, the goal of this meeting is to find out what thing you are creating that is of value to you and has the potential to be reused by others._ *

== Setting up the site visit ==

Prior to the SiteVisit the project should have completed their:
  * "Project Plan Posts", 
  * "DoaP d/b entry", and
  * several "progress posts"

see ProjectDocumentationInstructions for clarification.

Please do not prepare any presentations as this session is intended to be interactive so we can discuss where the project is going and what the key value argument are for the product you are producing.  You are welcome to have a slidedeck with diagrams if that helps, however a whiteboard and/or flipchart are jsut as acceptable for expressing ideas of the project.

=== Preparation for a good site visit: ===
The site visit will be an open agenda meeting intended to explore two things:

  * I.) Intangible Products: The "soft" products of the project are things like skills, relationships, observed patterns, failures, etc.  Your programme manager will want these documented in the project blog so best you get these things down as you go.
  * II.) Tangible Product: what is the thing you are creating that people will want to reuse.  While many projects will have several deliverables including things such as software, reports and policies to show for their hard work, it is essential that JISC narrows down to what the primary product is going to be from the project.  This is so we can help support you in telling the rest of the world about product.

== What to expect ==
  * The site visit will be a 2-3 hour meeting (preferably before or after lunch), please keep it informal so as many one-to-one/two conversations can occur. 
  * As many of the project team members as possible should attend at some point (not everyone has to be there at the same time, but the Programme Manager has come all that way to see people face-to-face so please do schedule time with all team members accordingly), a short tour around campus is nice as well to help contextualise the project team and its users.
    * Please make sure to send directions on how to get to your building well in advance of the site visit (as with all good public sector staff your Programme Manager will be coming via public transport, i.e. train).
  * This is your one and only visit with your programme manager so do take advantage of this meeting, e.g. Programme Manager's are often the most well informed cross-sector person who can make additional resources available for your project.
  * This meeting is about you and your project so you should do most of the talking; ideally your Programme Manager should be asking questions and taking notes while you provide as much insight as possible.  Please Note: All of this data will help inform the JISC on future spending initiatives.

=== Post site visit ===
After the site visit the Programme Manager has quite a few tasks they will follow-up on:
  * The Programme Manager will type up their notes and pass them back to colleagues within the Executive.
  * Actions from the notes will be followed up.
  * The notes (once approved by the project) will be passed on to other JISC staff for guidance and/or potential networks.
  * Themes from all the project site visits will be collected and analysed to inform the Programme Meeting (where all project come together to share experiences at the end of the programme)
  * These notes will be given to the "Programme Evidence Gatherer" who will write up a newsletter telling all the projects of the good things you are doing (along with links back to your project blog).
  * Dates for when the project will complete and deliver its "final product post" and "final budget" will be agreed, and any no-cost project extensions will be agreed as well.
