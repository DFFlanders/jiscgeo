_NOTE TO PROJECT ON THIS PAGE: This is my informal open notebook (wiki) page on your project aka this should be a meeting place for BOTH of us to take notes on your project, aka *the project isn't complete until I have this form filled out in full*. Any additions you make will be auto emailed to me so this is one of the best ways to communicate with me about your project as it progresses. You'll need me to give you edit rights by passing me your gmail or hotmail account /dff_
