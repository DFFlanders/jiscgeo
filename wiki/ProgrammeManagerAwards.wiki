#summary these were informal awards given by the JISC programme manager to projects who performed above and beyond their project remit.

As Programme Manager of the JISCgeo Programme over the past year, I am very please do give the following awards to projects who particularly impressed me with their above and beyond efforts.  These awards by no means reflect the success of the projects as I am happy to also announce that all projects have delivered their final products on time and to task.  Best of all, the recent Programme Meeting demonstrated that every University that had a JISCgeo Project have successfully "up their game" in how they integrate spatial competency at their institution.  I'm confident we have the foundations for a community of geospatial skills and expertise in these institution that will begin to spread to other institutions (afterall why would a student, teacher or researcher go to a university that doesn't have some kind of spatial competence in the teaching, learning or research?!).

For the JISCgeo Project of the Year we took a quick straw poll vote with everyone at the Programme meeting and winner was...

The [NatureLocator] Project!
