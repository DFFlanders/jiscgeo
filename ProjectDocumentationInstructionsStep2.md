## Getting Your Project Blog  Started ##
Can you first tell me why I am using a project blog?
  * So as to make your life easier we are suggesting a series of blog posts be written for the project as it progresses.
  * The posts are intended to disseminate the knowledge of the project in the now, rather than waiting until the end of the project to share your experiences.
  * Please make sure to use the correct tags for each post (including your own project tag) so that our robots can come along and aggregate all posts on various topics.
  * The posts can be as short or as long as you like so long as you keep your fellow projects and Higher Education community audience in mind, e.g. what would you want to read from another project?

### "Project Plan" Posts ###
To get your project blog started we REQUIRE that you publish your project plan as a series of project blog posts.  This should be an easy task as you should be copying and pasting your project bid into the following categories (please _shorten_ your bid as much as possible so it is easy to read for anyone who might encounter it on the Web).  And remember you can always come back to the various posts and update them via the comments sections when things change (and they will change).  Also please do take this opportunity to review and change your plan (things always change, and most likely have since you wrote your bid!).

| **Project Plan Posts** | **Description / Example** | **Required Tags** (please copy and paste these tags into your blog posts without the angle bracket: 

&lt;noAnglebrackets&gt;

 in tags) |

| Project Plan Post 1 of 7: Aims, Objectives and Final Output(s) of the project | This post should clearly list: a.) the overall aim, b.) the objectives that will support that aim, and c.) what products will be achieved by the end of the project.  It is important you serisouly consider how achievable your products are in over the duration of the project.  Bids often over promise what they can achieve, this is your opportunity to correct that and state a realistic goal for what the project can actually achieve.  Also please make it interesting to read, bids often use a bland language: not want we want on the blog. |

| Project Plan Post 2 of 7: Wider Benefits to Sector & Achievements for Host Institution | JISC projects are often a compromise between benefit to the local institution and the wider University sector.  The best projects are able to find a common middle ground that achieve both.  How are you going to achieve success both for your local institution and the wider community?  Please make sure you list the benefits for the host institution and then list the benefits for the sector overall.  This can include benefits that are both tangible products (e.g. reusable web apps) as well as intangible products (e.g. skills to be gained, relationships to be formed). |

| Project Plan Post 3 of 7: Risk Analysis and Success Plan | This post should attempt to forecast both the risks that might arise as the project progresses as well as how the project will manage sucess if its outputs become extremely popular?  Problems that often incur during projects is lack of knowledge around the licensing of the content or software they are using, or lack of planning for how much time it takes to engage users to participate in the project or how much time it takes to establish a community, etc|

| Project Plan Post 4 of 7: IPR (Licensing for Content, Source Code and Data) | This post should clearly state what licenses will be applied to all work and outputs throughout the course of the project.  You should state the creative commons license you are using for your blog, i.e. CC-attribution-ShareAlike; the license you are using for your code, i.e. Apache 2.0 (and don't forget to put in licensing headers in the code); and which license you are using for any data, i.e. PPDL.  Most importantly this post can then act as a default link to add to your any web resource you produce so that the IPR and licensing statement is displayed on every page you produce |

| Project Plan Post 5 of 7: Project Team Relationships and End User Engagement. | This post should explain who is on the project team and what responsibilities they have, also information on how engagement with end users should be included.  Please make sure to include a picture of each team member and explain what responsibilities they have over the course of the project.  Please don't just drop in bio info here, we really want to know what they people are actually doing on the project. |

| Project Plan Post 7 of 7: Budget | This initial project budget should be a forecast for future spending along with a justification for why the money should be spent this way, we realise this will change over the course of the project.  Please take this opportunity to establish where and how the budget will be managed within the institution, i.e. who is your grants manager.  Please feel free to express the budget in percentages so it is more easily understood, i.e. staff is 60% of the budget, user testing is 20%, hardware and software is 5%, etc.|
